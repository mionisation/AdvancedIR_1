To execute this, you need to specify a config.properties file in the main folder:
The parameters to be specified are "docs", "topics", "index", "setupIndex" and "similarity"
Description of the parameters and example values:

#This is the path to the TREC collection of documents. You can select a subset for testing purposes
docs = /your/document/directory/
#This is the path to the txt file containing the topics to be queried for
topics = /path/topicsTREC8Adhoc.txt
#This is the path where we want to build the index on the file system
index = /IR_INDEX/
#This determines if we want to re-index our documents or not: If yes, it must be to "true"; if not, any other value suffices
setupIndex = true
#Which similarity we want to use: BM25VA if value = "VA", BM25 if any other value
similarity = VA
